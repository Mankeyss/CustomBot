# INSTALLATION
To install the software you will have to do these steps:
1. Go to https://github.com/NadeNoob/CustomBot
2. Click the green "<> Code" button in the top right corner.
3. Click on whatever you prefer, but I recommend "Download ZIP".
4. Run main-win.exe, main-linux or main-macos depending on your system device.
5. You will now be prompted to enter your discord bot token and click Enter, you can find it here: 
https://github.com/Tyrrrz/DiscordChatExporter/wiki/Obtaining-Token-and-Channel-IDs#how-to-get-a-bot-token.
6. If you notice that the bot closes it may be because you have set up the bot incorrectly, so please give the bot admin perms in order to run smoothly.
7. You should now be prompted "Logged In As <BotName#0000>!" and the bot should appear online.
8. To get a list of commands type "help" in the console.
9. Done! You're now done with the installation process and can now use the bot for your own purpose.
